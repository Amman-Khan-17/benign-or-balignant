# Breast Cancer Diagnosis Predictor

## Overview

The **Breast Cancer Diagnosis Predictor** is a machine learning-powered tool designed to assist medical professionals in diagnosing breast cancer. Utilizing a set of measurements, the app predicts whether a breast mass is benign or malignant. 

### Features

- **Input Method**: Users can manually input measurements or connect the app to a cytology lab for direct data acquisition. (Note: The connection to laboratory machinery is not included in the app.)
- **Data Visualization**: The app provides a visual representation of the input data using a radar chart.
- **Prediction Output**: Displays the predicted diagnosis and the probability of the mass being benign or malignant.

### Dataset

The app was developed as a machine learning exercise using the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data). Please note that this dataset is intended for educational purposes only and may not be reliable for professional use.



## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language for machine learning and app development
- **Streamlit**: Framework for creating the web application interface
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: Libraries such as Scikit-learn for building the predictive model
